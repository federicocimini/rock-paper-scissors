# rock-paper-scissors
The Odin Project - Web Dev 101 - Project #2

We’re going to make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”. If you don’t know what that is check the wikipedia article or this ridiculous step-by-step. For the moment we’re just going to play the game from the browser console, but we will revisit it and add a front end later so don’t forget to keep the code on GitHub! 

Update 1/20/2020: Added a display as practice for DOM.
